# Flight-Data-Analysis
In this project, an Oozie based workflow is developed to analyze the on-time performance of airline data from the period of October 1987 to April 2008. The flight data analyzed can be downloaded from the link below: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7 One java program consisting of three MapReduce programs are used to analyze the flight dataset. Each MapReduce program solves one of the following problems using Oozie workflow :   A) B) C) The 3 airlines with the highest and lowest probability, respectively, for being on schedule. The 3 airports with the longest and shortest average taxi time per flight (both in and out), respectively. The most common reason for flight cancellations.
